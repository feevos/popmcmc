1. Remove constructor from memory allocation for steppers. In this way I can overload the function for incorporating the PriorRange that is 
needed for the case of the PCX stepper, and get rid of unnecessary code. 
2. Modularize - in a thread safe way ? - the call to functions for the evolution of a single individual (modularize for loop).
