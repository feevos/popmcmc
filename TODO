1. Modify algos/* so as not to have so many mcmc_algo_*.hpp files: Use templates for the different steppers (standard / pt) 
	Example something lig template < T1, T2 > evolve_single(Population, Pop_copy,T1 stepper, T2 mh_ratio) or something like this 

2. Add combo stepper+mh accept/reject 

3. Add variable names in the header of the mcmc chains file for the case of txt output. 

4. Add simple python analysis tool.
